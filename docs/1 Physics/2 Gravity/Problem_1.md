# Problem 1
# üåå Deriving Kepler‚Äôs Third Law for Circular Orbits

Kepler‚Äôs Third Law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital radius. Let's derive this from fundamental physical principles.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Step 1: Newton‚Äôs Law of Universal Gravitation

Newton's Law of Gravitation gives the attractive force between two masses:

$$F_{\text{gravity}} = G\frac{Mm}{r^2}$$

- $G$ = Gravitational constant  
- $M$ = Mass of the central body (e.g., Earth or Sun)  
- $m$ = Mass of the orbiting object (e.g., satellite or planet)  
- $r$ = Radius of the circular orbit  

---

## üîÑ Step 2: Centripetal Force for Circular Motion

Any object in a circular orbit must experience a centripetal force to stay on its path:

$$F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Step 3: Equating Gravitational and Centripetal Forces

Since gravity provides the centripetal force:

$$\frac{mv^2}{r} = G\frac{Mm}{r^2}$$

Cancel out $m$ (mass of the orbiting body):

$$\frac{v^2}{r} = G\frac{M}{r^2}$$

Multiply both sides by $r$:

$$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Step 4: Express Orbital Velocity in Terms of Period

Orbital velocity $v$ is the distance traveled in one orbit divided by the orbital period $T$:

$$v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$$

Substitute into the velocity equation:

$$\left(\frac{2\pi r}{T}\right)^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

Simplify:

$$\frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \frac{GM}{r}$$

Multiply both sides by $r$:

$$\frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{T^2} = GM$$

---

## üìê Final Form: Kepler‚Äôs Third Law

Rearranging for $T^2$:

$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} \cdot r^3$$

‚úÖ This is Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits!

- $T^2 \propto r^3$
- The constant of proportionality depends on the central mass $M$

## üß™ Python Verification

Let's simulate this law using Python.

# üå† Physical Meaning of Kepler‚Äôs Third Law

We previously derived Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits:

$$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}\cdot r^3$$

This relationship elegantly connects **time** (orbital period) with **space** (orbital radius) through the **gravitational constant** and the **mass of the central body**.

---

## üîç Interpretation of Each Term

- $T$: Orbital period ‚Äî how long it takes to complete one full orbit  
- $r$: Orbital radius ‚Äî the distance between the orbiting body and the central mass  
- $G$: Universal gravitational constant ‚Äî governs strength of gravitational interaction  
- $M$: Mass of the central body (e.g., Earth, Sun)  

---

## üß† Physical Insights

### 1. **Gravitational Control of Motion**

- The period $T$ **depends only on** the **mass of the central body $M$** and the **radius $r$** of the orbit.
- The orbiting body‚Äôs own mass $m$ **does not appear** in the final formula ‚Äî this reflects the equivalence principle.

### 2. **Increased Radius = Slower Orbit**

- From the formula:  
  $$T\propto r^{3/2}$$
- **Larger orbits** take significantly **longer** to complete.
- This explains why outer planets (like Neptune) move much slower than inner ones (like Mercury).

### 3. **Scaling and Proportionality**

- A doubling of $r$ increases $T$ by a factor of:  
  $$T\propto(2r)^{3/2}=2^{3/2}\approx2.83$$
- Time grows **faster than radius** ‚Äî orbital systems are *not* linear.

---

## üî≠ Astronomical Applications

### ‚úÖ 1. **Estimating Masses of Celestial Bodies**

- Rearranging:  
  $$M=\frac{4\pi^2r^3}{GT^2}$$
- If we know the radius and period of a satellite or moon, we can compute the mass of the planet/star it orbits.

### ‚úÖ 2. **Predicting Orbital Times**

- Given a known central mass and radius, we can compute how long any object will take to orbit.

### ‚úÖ 3. **Comparing Planetary Systems**

- By comparing $T^2/r^3$ across different systems, we can verify gravitational consistency:  
  $$\frac{T^2}{r^3}=\text{constant for a given }M$$

---

## üßÆ Python Demonstration: Constant Ratio $T^2/r^3$

Let‚Äôs confirm that this ratio is constant for Earth-centered orbits.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11  # m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
M = 5.972e24     # kg (mass of Earth)

# Orbital radii (meters)
radii = np.linspace(7e6, 4.2e7, 100)
T_squared = (4 * np.pi**2 * radii**3) / (G * M)
ratio = T_squared / radii**3

# üåå Astronomical Implications of Kepler‚Äôs Third Law

Kepler‚Äôs Third Law is more than a mathematical curiosity ‚Äî it's a **powerful tool in astronomy**. The relationship:

$$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3$$

gives us a direct bridge between **observable orbital motion** and **hidden physical properties** like mass and distance.

## üî≠ Applications in Astronomy

## 1. ü™ê Determining Planetary Masses

We can **rearrange Kepler‚Äôs Third Law** to solve for the mass $M$ of the central body:

$$M=\frac{4\pi^2r^3}{GT^2}$$

### ‚ú® What You Need:

# üå† Extending Kepler‚Äôs Third Law to Elliptical Orbits and Non-Planetary Bodies

Kepler's Third Law for **circular orbits** provides an elegant relationship between orbital period $T$ and orbital radius $r$:

$$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3$$

However, **most real-world orbits** are **elliptical**, not circular, and they often involve **non-planetary bodies** such as moons, satellites, comets, and even artificial objects. Let's explore how Kepler‚Äôs Law extends to these scenarios.

---

## 1. üåë Kepler‚Äôs Third Law for Elliptical Orbits

### 1.1. **Elliptical Orbits Overview**

For elliptical orbits, the orbital period $T$ is still related to the **semi-major axis** $a$ of the ellipse, not the instantaneous orbital radius $r$. The semi-major axis is the **average distance** between the orbiting body and the central mass.

### 1.2. **Kepler‚Äôs Law for Elliptical Orbits**

Kepler‚Äôs Third Law can be generalized to elliptical orbits as:

$$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2a^3}{GM}$$

Where:
- $a$: Semi-major axis of the ellipse
- $M$: Mass of the central body
- $T$: Orbital period

This is nearly identical to the formula for circular orbits, except now it uses the **semi-major axis $a$** instead of the orbital radius $r$.

### 1.3. **Why Semi-Major Axis?**
- The semi-major axis $a$ represents the **average orbital radius** and effectively smooths out the elliptical shape.
- The orbital period $T$ depends on the **average distance** rather than instantaneous distance, which is why $a$ is used.

### 1.4. **Elliptical Orbit Example**
- For an elliptical orbit, the **orbital period** $T$ is the same as it would be for a circular orbit with radius $a$.

---

## 2. üöÄ Non-Planetary Bodies: Satellites, Comets, and Exoplanets

### 2.1. **Kepler‚Äôs Law for Satellites**

Satellites orbiting a planet also obey Kepler‚Äôs Third Law. The period $T$ of a satellite‚Äôs orbit depends on the **mass of the planet** $M$ and the **semi-major axis** $a$ of the orbit.

- Satellite period: $$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2a^3}{GM}$$

### 2.2. **Comets in the Solar System**
- **Comets** follow highly elliptical orbits, with a **semi-major axis $a$** that places them far from the Sun at one extreme (aphelion) and close at the other extreme (perihelion).
- Their **orbital period** still follows the same form:
  $$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2a^3}{GM_{\text{sun}}}$$
- The **Sun‚Äôs mass** is used for calculating the period, even though the comet‚Äôs orbit is highly elliptical.

### 2.3. **Exoplanets**

- **Exoplanets** orbit distant stars, and their orbital periods depend on the star‚Äôs mass $M$ and the orbital semi-major axis $a$.
- The orbital period for exoplanets can be calculated using:
  $$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2a^3}{GM_{\text{star}}}$$
- For exoplanets, the mass of the **star** is used, and the semi-major axis $a$ refers to the average distance between the exoplanet and its star.

---

## 3. üß† Summary and Insights

### 3.1. **Extension to Elliptical Orbits**

- Kepler's Third Law holds true for **elliptical orbits** but uses the **semi-major axis** $a$ instead of $r$.
- The orbital period $T$ depends on the **average distance** between the orbiting body and the central mass.

### 3.2. **Non-Planetary Bodies**
- The law applies to **satellites**, **comets**, and **exoplanets** ‚Äî objects that are not planets but still obey the same orbital principles.
- The central mass $M$ changes depending on whether the object is orbiting a **planet** or a **star**.

### 3.3. **Practical Applications**
- **Satellite Design:** Orbital period and semi-major axis allow engineers to design satellites with desired orbital characteristics.
- **Space Missions:** For long-range missions (e.g., to outer planets or moons), Kepler‚Äôs Law helps estimate travel times.
- **Astronomical Observation:** Kepler‚Äôs Law is critical for understanding the dynamics of comet orbits, exoplanet discovery, and the motion of moons.

## 4. üßÆ Python Code for Orbital Period of an Elliptical Orbit

Let‚Äôs calculate the orbital period $T$ for a comet with a highly elliptical orbit. Given the **semi-major axis $a$** and **central mass $M$** of the Sun:

```python
import numpy as np

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11 # m^3 kg
```
# üåç Real-World Applications of Kepler's Third Law

Kepler‚Äôs Third Law allows us to predict orbital periods and distances for a variety of celestial bodies. By analyzing real-world examples such as the **Moon‚Äôs orbit around Earth**, **planetary orbits** (like Earth‚Äôs orbit around the Sun), and **Jupiter‚Äôs moons**, we can see the practical utility of this fundamental law.

---

## 1. üåô Moon‚Äôs Orbit Around Earth

### 1.1. **Known Values**

- Orbital period $T_{\text{moon}}$ of the Moon: $T_{\text{moon}} = 27.3$ days (converted to seconds: $T_{\text{moon}} = 27.3 \times 86400$ seconds)
- Average distance between the Earth and the Moon: $r = 3.84 \times 10^8$ meters
- Mass of Earth: $M_{\text{Earth}} = 5.972 \times 10^{24}$ kg

Using **Kepler‚Äôs Third Law** for the Moon‚Äôs orbit around Earth:

$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{GM_{\text{Earth}}}$$

### 1.2. **Orbital Period Calculation**

We can calculate the orbital period of the Moon by rearranging the above equation to solve for $T$:

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM_{\text{Earth}}}}$$

Let‚Äôs calculate this in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11  # m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)
M_earth = 5.972e24  # kg (mass of Earth)
r_moon = 3.84e8  # meters (average distance from Earth to Moon)

# Orbital period calculation (in seconds)
T_moon = 2 * np.pi * np.sqrt(r_moon**3 / (G * M_earth))
T_moon_days = T_moon / (60 * 60 * 24)  # Convert from seconds to days
print(f"Orbital period of the Moon: {T_moon_days:.2f} days")
```
# üõ∞Ô∏è Computational Task: Simulating Circular Orbits

In this section, we will build a Python script or Jupyter Notebook to simulate circular orbits based on Kepler's Third Law. The primary focus will be on simulating a **circular orbit** of a satellite (or any celestial object) around a central body (e.g., a planet or star).

### Objectives:
- Derive the relationship between **orbital period** and **orbital radius** for circular orbits.
- Implement a Python code to simulate the orbit.
- Visualize the orbital motion and calculate the **orbital period** and **orbital radius**.

---

## 1. üî≠ Deriving the Formula for Circular Orbits

For a circular orbit, we can combine the concepts of **centripetal force** and **gravitational force**.

### 1.1. Gravitational Force

The gravitational force acting on a satellite orbiting around a central body is given by:

$$F_{\text{gravity}} = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

Where:
- $G$ is the **gravitational constant** ($6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}$).
- $M$ is the **mass of the central body** (e.g., the Sun, Earth).
- $m$ is the **mass of the orbiting satellite**.
- $r$ is the **orbital radius** (distance from the center of the central body to the satellite).

### 1.2. Centripetal Force

The centripetal force required for a satellite to maintain a circular orbit is given by:

$$F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Where:
- $m$ is the mass of the satellite.
- $v$ is the **velocity** of the satellite.
- $r$ is the orbital radius.

### 1.3. Equating Gravitational and Centripetal Forces

For stable orbital motion, the gravitational force equals the centripetal force:

$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Simplifying this, we get:

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$

This is the orbital velocity of the satellite. The **orbital period** $T$ (the time it takes for the satellite to complete one orbit) is related to the orbital velocity by:

$$T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}$$

Substituting the expression for $v$:

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}$$

This is the **orbital period** formula for a satellite in a circular orbit.

---

## 2. üñ•Ô∏è Python Script to Simulate Circular Orbits

We can use the derived formulas to simulate the motion of a satellite in a circular orbit. Below is a Python script that simulates and visualizes the orbit of a satellite around a central body.

### 2.1. **Python Code Implementation**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11  # m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)

r = 7.5e6  # meters (orbital radius, adjust as needed)
T = 2 * np.pi * np.sqrt(r**3 / (G * M))  # Orbital period

# ü™ê Verifying Kepler‚Äôs Third Law Numerically
```
In this section, we will verify **Kepler's Third Law** numerically by calculating the orbital period of a planet or moon and comparing it to the values predicted by the law.

Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period ($T^2$) is directly proportional to the cube of the orbital radius ($r^3$). Mathematically, this relationship can be written as:

$$T^2 \propto r^3$$

In terms of gravitational forces, the orbital period $T$ for a circular orbit is given by:

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}$$

Where:
- $T$ is the **orbital period**.
- $r$ is the **orbital radius**.
- $G$ is the **gravitational constant** ($6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}$).
- $M$ is the **mass of the central body** (e.g., the Sun for planetary orbits).

We will now use this formula to verify Kepler‚Äôs Third Law numerically for a set of planets and moons.

- Mass of the central body ($M$) is given in **kg**.
- Orbital radius ($r$) is given in **meters**.

The orbital period $T$ will be calculated in **seconds**.

## 1. üßÆ Kepler‚Äôs Third Law Recap

We will use **Kepler‚Äôs Third Law** to verify and plot orbital data. Kepler‚Äôs Third Law states that the square of the orbital period ($T^2$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius ($r^3$). This is mathematically represented as:

$$T^2 \propto r^3$$

In terms of gravitational forces, the orbital period $T$ for a circular orbit is given by:

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}$$

Where:
- $T$ is the **orbital period**.
- $r$ is the **orbital radius**.
- $G$ is the **gravitational constant** ($6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}$).
- $M$ is the **mass of the central body**.

## 2. üìä Plotting Orbital Radius vs. $T^2$

### 2.1. Mathematical Relationship

The relationship between the square of the orbital period ($T^2$) and the cube of the orbital radius ($r^3$) is defined as:

$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{GM}$$

### 2.2. Python Code for Plotting

# üìö Deliverables: Gravity Project

This report provides a complete overview of the theoretical derivations, Python code implementations, simulation results, graphical visualizations, and discussions for understanding and applying **Kepler‚Äôs Third Law**.

---

## 1. üß† Theoretical Derivation and Explanation

### 1.1. Starting Point

- According to **Newton‚Äôs Law of Gravitation**, the force between two masses is:

$$F_g=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

- For circular motion, the necessary **centripetal force** is:

$$F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$

- Equating gravitational force and centripetal force:

$$\frac{GMm}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$

- Simplifying:

$$v^2=\frac{GM}{r}$$

- The **orbital period** $T$ is related to orbital speed $v$ and radius $r$ by:

$$T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}$$

Substituting $v$ from above:

$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}$$

Thus, squaring both sides:

$$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2r^3}{GM}$$

‚úÖ **Conclusion**: The square of the orbital period $T^2$ is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius $r^3$.
