# Problem 1
# üåå Deriving Kepler‚Äôs Third Law for Circular Orbits

Kepler‚Äôs Third Law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital radius. Let's derive this from fundamental physical principles.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Step 1: Newton‚Äôs Law of Universal Gravitation

Newton's Law of Gravitation gives the attractive force between two masses:

$$F_{\text{gravity}} = G\frac{Mm}{r^2}$$

- $G$ = Gravitational constant  
- $M$ = Mass of the central body (e.g., Earth or Sun)  
- $m$ = Mass of the orbiting object (e.g., satellite or planet)  
- $r$ = Radius of the circular orbit  

---

## üîÑ Step 2: Centripetal Force for Circular Motion

Any object in a circular orbit must experience a centripetal force to stay on its path:

$$F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Step 3: Equating Gravitational and Centripetal Forces

Since gravity provides the centripetal force:

$$\frac{mv^2}{r} = G\frac{Mm}{r^2}$$

Cancel out $m$ (mass of the orbiting body):

$$\frac{v^2}{r} = G\frac{M}{r^2}$$

Multiply both sides by $r$:

$$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Step 4: Express Orbital Velocity in Terms of Period

Orbital velocity $v$ is the distance traveled in one orbit divided by the orbital period $T$:

$$v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$$

Substitute into the velocity equation:

$$\left(\frac{2\pi r}{T}\right)^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

Simplify:

$$\frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \frac{GM}{r}$$

Multiply both sides by $r$:

$$\frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{T^2} = GM$$

---

## üìê Final Form: Kepler‚Äôs Third Law

Rearranging for $T^2$:

$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} \cdot r^3$$

‚úÖ This is Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits!

- $T^2 \propto r^3$
- The constant of proportionality depends on the central mass $M$

# üå† Physical Meaning of Kepler‚Äôs Third Law

We previously derived Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits:

$$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}\cdot r^3$$

This relationship elegantly connects **time** (orbital period) with **space** (orbital radius) through the **gravitational constant** and the **mass of the central body**.

---

## üîç Interpretation of Each Term

- $T$: Orbital period ‚Äî how long it takes to complete one full orbit  
- $r$: Orbital radius ‚Äî the distance between the orbiting body and the central mass  
- $G$: Universal gravitational constant ‚Äî governs strength of gravitational interaction  
- $M$: Mass of the central body (e.g., Earth, Sun)  

---

## üß† Physical Insights

### 1. **Gravitational Control of Motion**

- The period $T$ **depends only on** the **mass of the central body $M$** and the **radius $r$** of the orbit.
- The orbiting body‚Äôs own mass $m$ **does not appear** in the final formula ‚Äî this reflects the equivalence principle.

### 2. **Increased Radius = Slower Orbit**

- From the formula:  
  $$T\propto r^{3/2}$$
- **Larger orbits** take significantly **longer** to complete.
- This explains why outer planets (like Neptune) move much slower than inner ones (like Mercury).

### 3. **Scaling and Proportionality**

- A doubling of $r$ increases $T$ by a factor of:  
  $$T\propto(2r)^{3/2}=2^{3/2}\approx2.83$$
- Time grows **faster than radius** ‚Äî orbital systems are *not* linear.

## üî≠ Astronomical Applications

### ‚úÖ 1. **Estimating Masses of Celestial Bodies**

- Rearranging:  
  $$M=\frac{4\pi^2r^3}{GT^2}$$
- If we know the radius and period of a satellite or moon, we can compute the mass of the planet/star it orbits.

### ‚úÖ 2. **Predicting Orbital Times**

- Given a known central mass and radius, we can compute how long any object will take to orbit.

### ‚úÖ 3. **Comparing Planetary Systems**

- By comparing $T^2/r^3$ across different systems, we can verify gravitational consistency:  
  $$\frac{T^2}{r^3}=\text{constant for a given }M$$

## üßÆ Python Demonstration: Constant Ratio $T^2/r^3$

Let‚Äôs confirm that this ratio is constant for Earth-centered orbits.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11  # m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
M = 5.972e24     # kg (mass of Earth)

# Orbital radii (meters)
radii = np.linspace(7e6, 4.2e7, 100)
T_squared = (4 * np.pi**2 * radii**3) / (G * M)
ratio = T_squared / radii**3
