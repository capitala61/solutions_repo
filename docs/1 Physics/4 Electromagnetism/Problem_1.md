# Problem 1

# Simulating the Effects of the Lorentz Force

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

The Lorentz force governs the motion of charged particles in electromagnetic fields and is essential in understanding systems like:  
- Particle accelerators – guiding and accelerating beams.  
- Mass spectrometers – separating particles based on mass-to-charge ratio.  
- Plasma confinement devices (e.g., tokamaks) – controlling plasma using magnetic fields.  

Understanding the Lorentz force enables the design and analysis of such systems.

## 2. Lorentz Force Equation

The Lorentz force $\vec{F}$ acting on a charged particle is given by:

$$
\vec{F} = q (\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$

Where:  
- $q$: Charge of the particle  
- $\vec{E}$: Electric field  
- $\vec{B}$: Magnetic field  
- $\vec{v}$: Particle velocity  
Using Newton’s Second Law:

$$
\vec{F} = m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}
$$

We obtain the equation of motion:

$$
m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = q (\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$

This equation is generally solved numerically due to the complexity of $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$.
